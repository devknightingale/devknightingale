### Hi there 👋



Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on building my skills in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 
- 🌱 I’m currently enrolled in the B.S. Software Development from Western Governors' University. 
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on - not sure yet. I think I need to build up my skills more before I start working with others. I am still very new to coding.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with the best way to learn more advanced techniques with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 
- 💬 Ask me about ... my interests? Maybe. 
- 📫 How to reach me: I can be reached at kate.roland1@outlook.com.
- 😄 Pronouns: She/Her/Hers
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm a huge mod enthusiast. I have a working modlist of over 1100 mods for Skyrim Special Edition. (Send help!)

### Hi there ðŸ‘‹




- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on building my skills in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Currently, I have been spending time on sites like LeetCode, Codewars, and CodeSignal to gain some experience in solving coding problems. I haven't yet taken DSA, but I really want to get into an internship - and that means passing coding assessments! So I'm being as proactive as I can be in trying to teach myself how to solve coding problems while only having taken an Intro to Programming course in Python a few years ago. I am a Sophomore at WGU, and still have a couple terms left before I get into DSA and more in-depth programming classes, so my solutions probably won't be the best! 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently enrolled in the B.S. in Software Development from Western Governors' University. 
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: She/Her/Hers
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm a huge mod enthusiast. I have a working modlist of over 1100 mods for Skyrim Special Edition. (Send help!)

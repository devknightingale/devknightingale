### Hi there ðŸ‘‹





Iâ€™m currently enrolled in the B.S. in Software Development from Western Governors' University. I am a non-traditional student attending college full-time while also working full-time in the IT field. 
I have about six months left of my degree to go. 

In my free time, I spend my time playing video games and hunting down achievements, or trying out new mod setups. Sadly I don't have much of it! 
One of my goals after finishing my degree (besides getting a job in the field) is to finally build my own computer instead of relying on a pre-built.

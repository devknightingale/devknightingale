### Hi there ðŸ‘‹




- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on building my skills in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently enrolled in the B.S. in Software Development from Western Governors' University. 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on - not sure yet. I think I need to build up my skills more before I start working with others. I am still very new to coding.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with the best way to learn more advanced techniques with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about ... my interests? Maybe. 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: I can be reached at kate.roland1@outlook.com.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: She/Her/Hers
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm a huge mod enthusiast. I have a working modlist of over 1100 mods for Skyrim Special Edition. (Send help!)
